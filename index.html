<h2> What's going on here? </h2>
<p>
There are no random numbers (unless you randomize!) or complex formulas involved.
Just 0, 1, XOR, and the universe size. You could do this in your head. :-)
<p>
The XOR operator converts two binary inputs into a single output. The output is
1 if <em>only</em> one of the two inputs is 1, otherwise it is 0. The operation
is irreversible because we  cannot know which of the two inputs was 1.
<p>
If we apply this operator repeatedly in a ring-shaped data structure, we get
four different universe patterns for any ring size. Four because we can vary
movement direction and comparison direction. Note the symmetries -- any of the
four universes can be connected to copies of itself on all sides, ad infinitum.
<p>
The seed value of the ring is irrelevant -- it is set to 1 here; if it was set
to 0 we would have to use XNOR instead of XOR, but the result would be the same.
<p>
We display as many lines as our universe size, then refresh. But at any point in time,
the state of universe 249L1 is really just represented in 249 bits!
You can check its state by looking at the <code>multiverse</code>
variable in your developer console.
<p>
When you randomize, each of the universe arrays gets assigned a sequence of
random 0s and 1s. In some universes, this will put you in a state that's
otherwise unreachable -- in others it is just part of their natural cycle.
You may notice that large-scale patterns tend to disappear while small-scale
behavioral differences remain.
<p>
All universes repeat not just in space but also in time. When they start repeating varies. The contents of
the ring appear to repeat at minimum at <em>universe size</em><sup>3</sup> (for any universe with
a size that is a power of 2), and at maximum at 2<sup><em>universe size</em></sup>.
